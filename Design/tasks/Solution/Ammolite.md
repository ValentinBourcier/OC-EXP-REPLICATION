The description of the Ammolite bug can be found here: [../Description/Ammolite.md](../Description/Ammolite.md)

## Bug characteristics

The bug has the following characteristics:
- It is a real bug of Ammolite which itself is a real application (used by teachers to create well-balanced groups of students),
- although not the same scenario, it conforms to Ressia'12 example `Live Object Interaction` where an object is incorrectly displayed on the application (here, with a missing marker).
