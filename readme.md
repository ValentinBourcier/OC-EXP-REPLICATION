This repository contains the necessary instructions, data and artefacts to reproduce the Object-Centric Breakpoint experiments analysis.
It also contains pdfs of extracted data whose numbers have been reported in the paper but not the visualization.
Files are mostly in the markdown format, and better visualized with a markdown renderer.
Pdfs have been generated to facilitate reading for those who do not want to render markdown.
