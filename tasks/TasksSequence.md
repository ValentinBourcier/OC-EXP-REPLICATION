# Control and Treatment

The first task is always the control task, named **C**.
The last task is always the treatment task, named **T**.

**C** and **T** are randomly determined:
- 50% of the time, **C** = Ammolite and **T** = LightsOut
- 50% of the time, **C** = LightsOut and **T** = Ammolite

The sequence of tasks in the experiment is therefore always the following:

**C** -> Tutorial -> Warmup -> **T**
